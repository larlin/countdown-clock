A Project for developing a Android application to display the countdown data
from the countdown clock for Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and Vandenberg Airforce
Base (VAFB).

The data is retrieved and put into a JSON format by TWO9A here:
https://github.com/Two9A/ksc-json

We will parse this JSON and display it, preferably in some nice way.

Some ideas for architecture:

GUI-based on fragments to hopefully make it easy to make home screen widgets in
the future.

The Activity or Fragments will countdown the second to second countdown
internally to avoid pushing updates every second.

SyncAdapter together with will push updates either with some
interval to keep every thing in sync or when updates received from server.

SyncAdapter pushes the data directly to the Activity by using broadcasts
replacing this with a bound interface might be a good idea in the future.

Preferably we get some sort of push update API to the server data so we don't
have to pull it to get updates.



Fragments:

The first simple fragments should be lists with the same basic layout that
the NASA application uses. A example is available in doc/DSCOVR-screen.png.

The fragments should take lists of labels and data to set up a table layout.

The fragments should probably countdown the relevant time fields each second.
